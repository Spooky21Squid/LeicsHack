  LeicsHack (pronounced let's hack!) 2022 finally brings hackathons to Leicester! 
  LeicsHack is a 24 hour hackathon challenging student coders of all skill levels from all 
  universities to create and innovate while having fun. We will provide food for duration of the hack 
  (but bring extra snacks and water!), somewhere to sleep, and games for when you need a break. Let's Hack!
